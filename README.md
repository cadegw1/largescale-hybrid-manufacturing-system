Capstone Team #55: Large-scale Hybrid Manufacturing System
Team members: Cade Williams, Gerald Neyland, Noah Foster, David Hutton, Joel Wand

Entire system layout resides in: largescale-hybrid-manufacturing-system/kuka-sim/models/entire-system-latest.vcmx
It contains a complete simulated model of the large-scale hybrid manufacturing system along with simulations and configurations for the system.
Other models are individual components of the system for the user's convenience.

NOTE: The simulations were created with KUKA.SIM 4.0, in case of backwards compatibility issues
